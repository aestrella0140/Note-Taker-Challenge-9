## Description

This Project was to demonstrate my ablility to utilize Express Router APIs. Also to show my ablility to find and execute a new NPM package that wasnt taught in the demos. Using Heroku, you are able to use A live note taker application. By referencing the starter code from an already working front end application it was my job to add an api router using GET and POST methods. 


## Usage

-By navigating to my Heroku page and opening up my note taker application you are presented with the landing page. Click on the Get Started button you are taken to the note taker dashboard.

-Enter a note title in the note title text box. Enter notes for that topic title then press the save icon at the top of the page.

-By clicking save it will set that note card on the left colomn saving your note card.

-by pressing the + button at the top of the page it will add a new note to the page.

-by pressing the red Trash can icon It will delete the selected note card.
